# SQL-COVID-Project

This is a project I chose to explore the COVID data that much of the world has been accumulating for quite some time now. It demonstrates some basic to advanced SQL
skills by using a series of queries to explore the COVID situation as it was happening, from beginning to now, with a particular focus on case loads, deaths, and 
vaccinations and how these compare between countries.

The excel files contain the trimmed data used in the analysis while the two SQL files contain the queries used; contains some queries I tweaked in order to make an effective Tableau Dashboard that 
can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092. All was written in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Data retrieved from OurWorldInData.org.
