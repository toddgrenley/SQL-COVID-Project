# SQL-Portfolio-Project

This is a project I chose to explore the COVID data that much of the world has been accumulating for quite some time now. It demonstrates some basic to advanced SQL
skills by using a series of queries to explore the COVID situation as it was happening, from beginning to now, with a particular focus on case loads, deaths, and vaccinations
and how these compare between countries. All was written in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Data retrieved from OurWorldInData.org.
