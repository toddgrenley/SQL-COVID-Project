# SQL-COVID-Project

This is a project I chose to explore the COVID data that much of the world has been accumulating for quite some time now. It demonstrates some basic to advanced SQL
skills by using a series of queries to explore the COVID situation as it was happening, from beginning to now, with a particular focus on case loads, deaths, and vaccinations
and how these compare between countries.

The first file is the initial data exploration and some analysis while the second file contains some queries I tweaked in order to make an effective Tableau Dashboard that can 
be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092. All was written in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Data retrieved from OurWorldInData.org.
