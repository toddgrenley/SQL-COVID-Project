# SQL-COVID-Project

This is a project I chose to explore the COVID data that much of the world has been accumulating for quite some time now. It demonstrates some basic to advanced SQL
skills by using a series of queries to explore the COVID situation as it was happening, from beginning to now, with a particular focus on case loads, deaths, and 
vaccinations and how these compare between countries.

The excel files contain the trimmed data while the two SQL files contain the queries used in the analysis; the first one is the intial exploration and the second one 
contains some queries I tweaked in order to make an effective Tableau dashboard that can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092. All was written 
in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Data retrieved from OurWorldInData.org.
